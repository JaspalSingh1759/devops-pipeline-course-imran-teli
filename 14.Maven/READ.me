The target folder in Maven is created during the build process and contains all the output generated by the build. Here's what you need to know about the target folder:
Creation
The target folder is created automatically when you run Maven commands that involve building your project, such as mvn compile, mvn test, or mvn package12.
Contents
The target folder contains:
Compiled classes: Java classes compiled from the source code in src/main/java are placed in target/classes13.
Compiled test classes: Test classes compiled from src/test/java are stored in target/test-classes36.
Generated sources: Any sources generated during the build process are placed in target/generated-sources and target/generated-test-sources6.
Build artifacts: The main output of your build, such as JAR or WAR files, is placed directly in the target folder12.
Temporary files: Any intermediate files generated during the build process are stored here25.
Characteristics
Temporary nature: The contents of the target folder are considered temporary and can be safely deleted at any time. Running mvn clean will remove this folder2.
Not version controlled: The target folder should typically be excluded from version control systems like Git or SVN5.
Distinct from local repository: The target folder is separate from Maven's local repository (~/.m2/repository) which stores downloaded dependencies and installed artifacts2.
Remember that the target folder is recreated and populated each time you build your project, ensuring you always have the latest compiled version of your code and its associated artifacts.

Yes, the target folder in a Maven project contains the output of unit tests. Specifically, it includes:
Compiled Test Classes: The compiled Java classes for unit tests located in src/test/java are stored in the target/test-classes directory. These classes are compiled during the test-compile phase using the Maven Compiler Plugin1.
Test Reports: The results of unit test executions, such as pass/fail statuses and stack traces for failures, are stored in the target/surefire-reports directory. These reports are generated by the Maven Surefire Plugin, which is responsible for running unit tests23.
Test Resources: Any resources required by the unit tests (e.g., configuration files from src/test/resources) are also copied to the target/test-classes directory4.
Thus, the target folder not only contains the compiled test classes but also the results and resources associated with unit tests.


Maven stores all project dependencies in a local repository on your machine. By default, this local repository is located at:
On Windows: C:\Users\<username>\.m2\repository
On Unix/Linux: ~/.m2/repository
On macOS: /Users/<username>/.m2/repository
This local repository contains all the project dependencies (JAR files) that Maven downloads from remote repositories when building your projects13. When you run a Maven command that requires dependencies, Maven first checks this local repository before attempting to download from remote sources.
You can change the location of the local repository by modifying the settings.xml file, typically found in the conf directory of your Maven installation or in your user's .m2 directory3. To change the location, you would add or modify the <localRepository> tag in settings.xml:
xml
<settings>
  <localRepository>E:/devsetup/M2</localRepository>
</settings>
This would set your local repository to E:/devsetup/M2 instead of the default location3.
It's important to note that this local repository is shared across all your Maven projects on your machine, rather than each project having its own dependency folder (unlike Node.js with its node_modules folder)1.
